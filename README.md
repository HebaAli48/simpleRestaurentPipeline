# Restaurant App Jenkins Pipeline Setup

This guide will help you set up a Jenkins pipeline for a simple restaurant app to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:
- Jenkins installed and running (you can use [Jenkins official documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/) to set up Jenkins).
- A version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) where your restaurant app code is stored.
- Basic knowledge of Jenkins and its interface.

## Steps to Set Up Jenkins Pipeline

### 1. Set Up Jenkins and Install Required Plugins

- **Install Jenkins** (if not already installed).
- **Install the following Jenkins plugins**:
  - Git Plugin
  - NodeJS Plugin (for installing Node.js and managing npm)
  - Pipeline Plugin (for creating a Jenkinsfile)

### 2. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Project

1. Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on **New Item**.
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., `restaurant-app-pipeline`).
3. Select **Pipeline** and click **OK**.

### 3. Configure the Pipeline

1. **Source Code Management**: 
   - Select **Git**.
   - Provide the Git repository URL (e.g., your GitHub repository link).
   - If the repository is private, provide the credentials.

2. **Build Triggers**:
   - You can trigger the build manually or by using **GitHub hook trigger** (useful for automatic builds on code push).

3. **Pipeline Script**:
   - In the **Pipeline** section, select **Jenkinsfile** and enter the SCM info like git Url and Branch Specifier (*/main or */master).

### 4. Save and Run the Pipeline

- Click **Save** and then **Build Now** to manually trigger the pipeline.
- Monitor the console output to see the progress of each stage.

### 5. Monitor Pipeline

- Check the Jenkins dashboard for the build history and logs.
- If any errors occur during the pipeline, check the console logs for specific errors and fix them.

## Understanding the Jenkinsfile

- **Checkout**: This stage clones the restaurant app repository.
- **Install Dependencies**: This installs all necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
- **Run Tests**: This runs any tests that you have set up (e.g., unit tests).
- **Build**: This compiles or prepares the application for deployment (e.g., minification, bundling).
- **Deploy**: This is where your app gets deployed (you can adjust the script depending on your deployment method, such as pushing to a server or a platform like Heroku or AWS).
- **Cleanup**: This stage handles any necessary cleanup tasks.
- **Post**: The `post` block handles notifications or actions after the pipeline has finished, depending on the result (success or failure).

## Conclusion

Your Jenkins pipeline is now set up for your restaurant app. The pipeline will automatically:
- Clone your app repository.
- Install dependencies.
- Run tests.
- Build the app.
- Deploy it.
  
If any steps fail, you can monitor the output in the Jenkins console and take action accordingly.
